# Cryptobuyer
Simple program that creates a "Mutual Fund" for Cryptocurrencies

Basically the thought is - each week I'd put in an arbitrary amount of money that would get distributed evenly among the top 20 currencies by market cap for the week.

EDIT:

Seems like Poloniex is an exit scam waiting to happen, so I recommend not using this until I can release a version for Bittrex. 
Second release will probably also have an accompanying front end so you don't have to run this through the console.
